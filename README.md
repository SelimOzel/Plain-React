# Plain-React
Plain react-bootstrap web site with a navigation bar. The plain-react.html can be run as a stand-alone page from a browser although links would only work properly with vibe-d framework.

Just run ```dub run -a x86_mscoff``` on a Windows 10 machine to start server at ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/```. Dub command might vary based on platform.
